Match your vision to your ability to execute maintenance after initial build is
maintenance is vital no education leads to cargo-culting and resentment.

Vision vs manpower

- 2013: components for a single app. A constrained vision, means a simpler
  build. As one team is makeing and consuming components, you can get away with
  less stringent education as the system's consumers are you and the people you
  work closely with on a daily basis. If something is poorly documented it is
  easy to ask the creator as they're sitting next to you.
- Amen: shared components between two apps, with two distinct dev teams. This
  puts an increased burden on documentation. Education is harder as you have
  more people to tell, but we didn't have the the time to dedicate to improving
  documentation as we were focusing on app builds ourselves. Ths lead to people
  not fully understanding how to use the tools offered
- Shopify: Our Polaris design system has a much larger remit - aiming to be used
  by several teams within Shopify however we have a dedicated team to build
  components, work with consumers, and to create written documentation and
  examples. We have the time and space to focus on improving polaris instead of
  assuming that a collaborative effort will magically happen.

Takeaway: Match your vision to your ability to execute. Amen overreached - we
tried to do something with increased scope but we didn't have the dedicated time
to invest in the cross-team communication to ensure it was a success. If you
want to create a system that affects several teams then you'll want a dedicated
team to be responsible for your design system. "Build it and they will come" for
these expansive projects doesn't work because people need to know why and how
they should use your design system

Ongoing Maintenance

- 2013: As the team building components and the team implementing them were one
  and the same we had flexibility to update logic that suited us

You can kind Ideolology was lead by /progs but we didn't have

Where do the components /styleguide live 2013: in app. Means rapid itteration
and ability to preview in context. Ideal if you're building pages while creating
components. Allows you to focus on page building Amen: Separate repo. Allowed
for sharing between apps. Great if you've got a dedicated people looking after
it like at Shopify. We didn't, /progs and /radio both looked after it, but made
it harder to

Constraints

- 2013: single app, no fragmentation of usage, rapid development as components
  are in same repo as project

- Responisbility of a single component was defined after seeing it in multiple
  design context to ensure that the page

Amen:

Sharing across two app means a separate library - increased complexity - having
to worry about releases - slower turn around speed - harder to build within the
context of an app (fucking about with symlinks)

- ended up being one team that implemented core functionality, then a different
  team maknig use of it. Poor dogfooding experience and tech being forced upon
  people

  - education and positioning a team as "we're all in this together and we exist
    to enable otheres" instead of being the fun police stifling innovation.

  - Spin this out to out to how shopify's is trying to combat that perception

Focus shift- team who build project were unable to evangelise due to having to
focus on their own produce

designers who brought into the idea didn't

TL;DR:

Downfall was due to attempting a wider remit but not haveing the resources to do
justice to the scope of the project
